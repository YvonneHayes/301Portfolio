High Order functions

1. Add a high order function that does some processing that includes calling the function that was passed in as a parameter. Use that higher order function to affect what your portfolio app displays to the user.

For this I will completely refactor the part of my About page that displays my interest and use a High Order Function instead to do the job. I'll have a function called useNext that includes an array variable that has 3 'hobbies' in it. The function will loop over those hobbies via a forEach method. Then I'll have a hobbies function that's mostly concerned with putting the info into the html. Finally I'll pass hobbies() to next() and that should render the info the way I intend it to. I'll know if it all works if the info is displayed on the About page.

2. Add a high order function that generates a closure. The high order function must accept at least one parameter (call it "A" here) that affects the hidden context of the closure function. The closure must change what the user sees in the browser, and the closure must accept at least one parameter (call it "B") that affects that behavior. "A" should be based on user interaction, such as data the user types into a text input area.

For my high order function that generates a closure I want to have the user input their name in a prompt and then use this input to display varying messages back to the user.
First I collect the user's Name via a prompt and store it in variable (inputName). Then I have a function called userName(). It takes the parameters of inputName as well as pageId. Page id is important as I need to it specify which message should be displayed. Inside this function I have another function called makePage(). This is mainly concerned with creating the info in the html. After that I store userName() in a variable with two params - inputName and the pageId. This displays personalized message to the user and welcomes them either to the Portfolio page or the About page depending on the pageId I give to the function. The inputName (a.k.a the user name is remembered the entire time). I'll see if it works if the user's name and the correct page name is displayed on the page.
